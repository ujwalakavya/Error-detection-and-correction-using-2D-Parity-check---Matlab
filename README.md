# Error-detection-and-correction-using-2D-Parity-check---Matlab

Using multiple redundancies is expensive, especially when a huge amount of data needs to be transferred between the systems. Also, when we require a certain degree of error correction, So we adapt the idea of parity bits (which were cheaper) to not only detect but also correct errors. The idea is a 2D parity check where we arrange the stream of bits we want to send in a two-dimensional MxN array.

Code is developed and tested to mimic natural communication by randomly inducing errors in the matrix and trying to correct them. This program detects two-bit errors and corrects one. on Matlab, and at the end of the report, you can find screenshots of the result.
